***Purpose***

Using New York bike sharing program as an illustration, this project seeks to convince investors that bike sharing program in Des Moines as a solid business proposal.
As part of the process, we deployed pandas to convert the trip duration column into an appropriate datetime datatype. We proceeded to map how long bikes were checked out by all riders and by gender. We illustrated the number of trips taken per hour per day by riders. Our project reveals days of the week a user might checkout a bike by user type and gender.

***Result***

Our results reveal that most bikes were checked out during the first 20 minutes and thereafter the rate slowed down considerably. (Sheet 1)

Most bikes were checked out by males followed by females and then people of unknown gender. The males checked out bikes approximately 3X more than females and about 10X more than others. )Sheet 2)

Sheet 3 breaks down the rides into weekdays per hour. Relatively few rides (about 360) were taken within the first 5 hours of the day. There was an increase in the rides from 6 am and the rides began to taper down from 20.00 hours. Most bikers rode between 6-10.00am and between 16.00 and 20.00hours. Also the weekends- Saturdays and Sundays witnessed the most rides with the peak rides at 8.00hours and again at 17.00-18.00hours.




***Summary***
Additional inquiry which could carried out include: determining what sttaion bikers most frequently use and stops they make.

Using gender,we can determine which gender bikes faster and which days of the week they appear to prefer to bike.
