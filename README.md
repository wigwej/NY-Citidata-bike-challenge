# NY-Citidata-bike-challenge


***Purpose***

Using New York bike sharing program as an illustration, this project seeks to convince investors that bike sharing program in Des Moines as a solid business proposal.
As part of the process, we deployed pandas to convert the trip duration column into an appropriate datetime datatype. We proceeded to map how long bikes were checked out by all riders and by gender. We illustrated the number of trips taken per hour per day by riders. Our project reveals days of the week a user might checkout a bike by user type and gender.

***Result***

Our results reveal that most bikes were checked out during the first 20 minutes and thereafter the rate slowed down considerably. 

Most bikes were checked out by males followed by females and then people of unknown gender. Th emales checked out bikes 3X more than females and about 10X more thann others.
